# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic implementation of the timeless Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "X's and O's".

## 📖 About

This project implements a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3×3 grid
2. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in empty squares
3. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game is a tie
